## Description
This is the 14th challenge for my Coding bootcamp journey. For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to create a tech blog that utilizes `node`, `sequelize`, 
`express`, and `express sessions` to conduct user authorization and create a user login system. Users can create and edit posts as well as comment on other posts.

Currently the submit post button is not functional but am working to fix it as soon as possible.
